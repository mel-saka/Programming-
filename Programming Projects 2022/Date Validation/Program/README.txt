--HOW TO RUN CODE--
In the terminal run the following 2 commands:
------
javac date.java
java date
------
 Make sure to be in the same directory of folder.

Input is being taken from "dateFile.txt" testing file must be with the same name because the code looks specifically for that name.


--Research Resourses--
I found this Microsoft doc page to be very helpful in explaining on what makes a leap year:
