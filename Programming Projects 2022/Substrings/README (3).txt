Testing:I tested using the sample input provided on the etude sheet, to observe whether it produced the same output, with the same sequence. I also trialled larger alphabet inputs such as abcdefg. I tested across many different alphabets and checked if they were correct.

How to run the program:
When the program is run, the user will be prompted with a string asking for input alphabet, the code will run and output the resulting longest substring which has no repeating combinations, given the input.
