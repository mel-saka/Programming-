Testing: 
Testing was accomplished by running through a number of IBM floats and comparing out put with expected output.
edge cases were tested like large numbers, small numbers and 0.

Running:
Can be run on any IDE that supports java as long as files are in the same package.
input mand output must be bin files.
There are some small rounding issues for numbers that get very small like subnormals but aside from that it should work fine.
