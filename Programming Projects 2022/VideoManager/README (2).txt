The program encounter utilises the single instance of Manager class, however it has nestled instances of each video. The video file includes an Image (not needed to implement), alongside the file details such as fps, start frame, end frame, name, and description. 

How to run the program:
When the program is run, the user will be prompted with the following list: 
type 'add' to add a video 
type 'delete' to delete video 
type 'list' to see the list of videos
If user types add, then it will input the video with all the details above (creates a nestled instance of this video) under the single manager class. If delete is selected, then the user can write the name of the video (based on what name they added), and it will be removed. The list shows all the current videos that have been added.
